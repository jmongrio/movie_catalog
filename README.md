# Movie Catalog
The Movie Catalog application is a web-based system designed to manage and display a collection of movies. It allows users to browse, search, and manage movie details such as title, genre, release date, and ratings. The application is built using .NET for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Key Components
### Backend (ASP.NET Core)
API Development: The backend is developed using ASP.NET Core, which provides a robust and scalable framework for creating RESTful APIs. The APIs handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing movies.
Data Access: Entity Framework Core is used for database interactions, providing an object-relational mapping (ORM) to easily work with a SQL database.
Authentication and Authorization: ASP.NET Core Identity can be used to manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the catalog.

### Frontend (React)
User Interface: The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web pages.
State Management: State management is handled using Redux or React's Context API, ensuring efficient state management and data flow within the application.
API Integration: Axios or Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests to the ASP.NET Core backend, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
